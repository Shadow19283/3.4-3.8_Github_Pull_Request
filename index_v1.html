				<p style="font-size:1vw;">A video game or computer game is an electronic game that involves interaction with a user interface or input device (such as a joystick, controller, keyboard, or motion sensing device) to generate visual feedback from a display device, most commonly shown in a video format on a television set, computer monitor, flat-panel display or touchscreen on handheld devices, or a virtual reality headset. Most modern video games are audiovisual, with audio complement delivered through speakers or headphones, and sometimes also with other types of sensory feedback (e.g., haptic technology that provides tactile sensations). Some video games also allow microphone and webcam inputs for in-game chatting and livestreaming.</p>
				
				
				<p style="font-size:1vw;">Video games are typically categorized according to their hardware platform, which traditionally includes arcade video games, console games, and computer games (which includes LAN games, online games, and browser games). More recently, the video game industry has expanded onto mobile gaming through mobile devices (such as smartphones and tablet computers), virtual and augmented reality systems, and remote cloud gaming. Video games are also classified into a wide range of genres based on their style of gameplay and target audience.</p>

			<p1 style="font-size:1vw;"> In the twenty-first century, the video-game industry grew into a multibillion-dollar business. Much of this growth can be attributed to hardware improvements that allow for increased graphical fidelity and gameplay complexity, as well as improvements in communications technologies that allow for online game play. Video games have become hugely popular, with major influence in pop culture and beyond. Many gamers play casually, but highly organized competitions have also gained a strong following, giving rise to the lucrative esports industry. Aside from entertainment, video games have also been used as aids in education, science, medicine, art, and business. The various elements of video-game production and development have also become popular educational and professional pursuits, significantly shaping trends in academia, the workforce, and the economy as a whole.</p1>
